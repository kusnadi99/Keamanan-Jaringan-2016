Meet 6 Network Security
=======================

DoS is a technique to attack the website or ip on the internet. Attacker send packet data to website or ip until the website is down and we can't access it because the service can't handle request from many users.

To overcome this, because the attacker immediately drawn or direct IP address or domain to the target then the thing to do to avoid it is:
> - Make checks periodically to IP transmit or process data packets redundant, since it is a characteristic that is practiced by people who perform a denial.
> - Block the sending IP packets of the redundant data so that our website can not be accessed again.
> - Use a good firewall to avoid damage to important data that we have.
