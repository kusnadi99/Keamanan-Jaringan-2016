Meet 2 Network Security
=======================

Vulnerability or can be interpreted in Indonesian is the **kerentanan**, if seen in the light of Network Security is a vulnerability or gap that occurs in the computer system that we have built which may result in an attack by parties who are not responsible for manipulating, marusak even steal data available in our computer.

There are various ways that are used in data theft committed by these attackers, one of them is doing arp poisoning. Arp poisoning is one of the methods pentest or penetration testing that allows us to poison the computer or pc recorded in a single access point (sense more easily if we fall into the same wifi). Performers arp poisoning can perform any surveillance conducted each computer or process what it would do even changed the ip address of the router so inaccessible and lead to users on the access point can not access the internet.

There are several ways that can be used to prevent it, we could check with an access point by using the command "arp -a" at the command line (cmd), if there are two IP Address Gateway that together we can decide one of them. How rude next is a way to restart directly on the router. Although this is not permanent because the attacker can attack again, better to prevent than to let an attacker is free to control what they want..
