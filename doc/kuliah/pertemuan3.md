Meet 3 Network Security
=======================

Port Scanning is one of technique to know how to transfer data from one computer to another.

You should know that hacker use this technique to hack our systems. They can hack our systems because many port was opened, and we don't know that. So, we should know that's many port is used to transfer data which is :

> - Port 80 for **Http**
> - Port 21 for **Ftp**
> - Port 22 for **SSH**

To keep secure our system, we can turn on **Firewall**.

Another way is, block our port which is not used. Or we can check our network periodically to know if the network is not stable.
