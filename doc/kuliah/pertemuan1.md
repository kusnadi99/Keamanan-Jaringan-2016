OSI vs TCP/IP
=============

OSI and TCP/IP has not much any different. The purposes is to sharing information or data using a network method. But, TCP/IP was already applied since 1970s. 

OSI intended for computer network method for make standard networking in some company or vendor. 

**Why TCP/IP more used than OSI?**
TCP/IP has a computer network method ideal to transfer information or data around the internet/cloud. And another different beetween OSI and TCP/IP is the part of layer. TCP/IP has a layer slightly than OSI, TCP/IP has 4 layer and OSI has 7 layer. That makes a little bit TCP/IP was choosen than OSI.

And we all know that OSI is just imaginary theory which is not implementation.

TCP/IP will be used for computer network method ideal currently.
